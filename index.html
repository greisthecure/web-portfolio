	 <h2>About Me</h2>
	 <p>Right after i graduate Lanchcode. I made my first website which was for my Untie business. It's a healthcare business for the elderly.</p>
	 <p>I still haven't got a job and Lanchcode didn't help me much. So now I'm continuing my journey and taking matters into my own hands.</p>
	 <p> I plan to build a business website where i showcase all the websites i have done and just keep growing and get a job to push me even further.</p>
